# Centron Q-value test

 - Examination of the dynamic adsorption capacity
 - Increases the knowledge of your equipment
 - Indicates the reduction of the dynamic adsorption capacity due to natural ageing, fouling and /or chemical affection
 - Predicts the necessity for adsorbent exchange
 - Offers the possibility to compare different adsorbents
 - Should be part of the maintenance procedure 
 - Helps to solve problems

A satisfactory operation of adsorption equipment, (compressed air driers, gasdriers,liquid driers) is strongly dependent on the quality of the applied adsorbent and on the remaining quality after the equipment has been on stream in a process during a number of years. An adsorbent, like activated alumina, silicagel or molecular sieves will generally loose its capacity gradually.
At design of an adsorption unit this phenomenon should be taken into account, so that the equipment can also meet the requirements during the appointed lifetime of the adsorbent.

The reduction of the capacity is caused by affection of the tremendous internal active surface.
This reduction is dependent on a number of factors as natural aging, chemical affection and fouling by irregenerable components.
The reduction is mostly not visible.
An external dirty adsorbent can still have an excellent quality, an apparently clean adsorbent can be deteriorated substantively.
Thus it is important to check the quality of the adsorbent from time to time to be able to take preventive measures.

Test: 
By means of a very accurate examination of the heat produced with adsorption of water, by a sample of adsorbent. This is a measure for the active surface of an adsorbent and thus of the relative quality. The value is compared to the original value so that the status of the adsorbent in the equipment can be defined.
