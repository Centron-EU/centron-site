## Introduction, activities:

 - Analysis of the quality of new and used adsorbent of adsorption equipment.
 - Process design for industrial air- and gasdryers.
 - Capturing and recovery of gaseous hydrocarbons.

## Explanation:

Adsorption is widely used in physical processes for drying, purifying and separation of air and gases under atmospheric or increased pressure.
Adsorption equipment is used in various industrial applications, e.g. oil/gas recovery, chemical industry, tankers, telecommunication, storage of moisture-sensitive products, drying and conditioning of water treatment plant, biogasproduction, compressed air conditioning, CO2 purifying at breweries etc.

## Adsorbentanalysis:
 - Q-value test
 - E0.6 value
 - L.O.I. test
 - Special tests, Ageing, Crush test
 - Advice, process design
