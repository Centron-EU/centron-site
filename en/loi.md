## L.O.I. test

(Loss on ignition)

This test is to determine the loss of an adsorbent on heating from an initial defined state to a specified high temperature during a specified time, enough long to remove the components to loose.

The removed components are water, CO2, volatile inorganic and combustible organic material.

The heating temperature depends on the requirements and is generally specified between 500° and 1100° C.
