## E 0.6 Value

The E 0.6 value shows the amount of water that has been adsorbed by an adsorbent when in equilibrium with a relative humidity of 60%, in general at 20° C. 

This value is mostly used to check whether the static adsorption capacity meets the specification of the relevant adsorbent.

This value is also used to compare different adsorbents.
